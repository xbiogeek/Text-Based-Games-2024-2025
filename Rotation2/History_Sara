# Start of the story
print("Title: The Portal of Shadows\n")


print("Zane, the dog with eyes like burning embers, and Nyx, the cat with fur as dark as night, were wandering through the woods.")

print("They were not ordinary animals. They had always known that something beyond the world they knew existed, something magical.")

print("That evening, they discovered a strange, glowing portal, hidden in the shadows of ancient trees.")


# The portal opens

print("\nZane sniffed the air, his fur bristling. \"What is this?\"")

print("Nyx stepped forward cautiously. \"I think we should enter. But... we must be careful.\"")

print("Without another word, they both stepped into the portal. The air grew thick, and the world around them seemed to twist.")


# The challenge

print("\nThey found themselves in a place unlike any other—an endless field of black roses, glowing faintly under a purple sky.")

print("In the distance, a shadowy figure appeared. \"Only those who face their true fear can leave,\" the figure whispered.")

print('Zane growled. "We don\'t fear anything."') # Comillas corregidas

print("Nyx's eyes glowed brighter. \"We face our fear together.\"")


# The test of courage

print("\nSuddenly, the ground split open, and a deep chasm appeared between them.")

print("Zane stared at it. \"I\'ll jump first,\" he said, his voice steady.") # Comillas corregidas
print("Without hesitation, Zane leapt across the chasm, landing safely on the other side. Nyx followed, her paws barely touching the ground.")

print("They had passed the first test: courage.")


# The escape

print("\nThe shadowy figure nodded. \"You have proven yourselves. The portal to your world awaits.\"")

print("The ground trembled, and the portal reappeared before them.")

print("Zane and Nyx stepped through, returning home—but they knew they had changed. Whatever came next, they would face it together.")

print("\nThe end.")
